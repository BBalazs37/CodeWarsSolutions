My solutions for [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) challenges. Mostly in JavaScript, but some Python and SQL practice too. Not all of them, but the ones that might be useful later or the ones I just simply liked. 8 kyus are usually omitted, they are usually one-liner knowledge checks.

For the challenge description, follow the link in the first line comment.
